*Hi there ðŸ‘‹ Really nice to meet you...*

## About Me

I have over 10 years experience designing and developing for the web. I started as a Web Developer in 2011 when I co-founded a web services agency with a few friends. My main role was leading that cross-functional team to provide web-based solutions to customers. I also built websites, mostly using custom WordPress themes and plugins we developed in-house.

In 2017, I started a new web hosting business, as a freelancer, called [GrottoPress](https://www.grottopress.com). My role at GrottoPress spans from Systems Engineering, DevOps & SRE, to Full Stack Web Development. I also handle Accounting and other administrative tasks.

I have a strong background in Cybersecurity, and have designed and built solutions that secure software systems at different levels of the web stack.

I am very passionate about solving problems with code, and value relationships that foster growth through learning, and especially ones that are not afraid to try something new.

In my spare time, I like to explore emerging technology, especially new programming languages. I also like to solve code challenges, watch movies, and travel once in a while.
